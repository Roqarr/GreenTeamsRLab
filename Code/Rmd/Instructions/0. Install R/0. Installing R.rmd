# Defines the parameters to pass into the Rmd document for knitting.
# Parameters allow you to pass arguments into the Rmd document, similar to a function, to create dynamic reports.
# Similar to a function, you must define the parameters at the beginning of the report, and can assign default values.
# These parameters can be accessed inside the Rmd document using a special environment object: 'params'
# The 'params' object is a special read-only environment object.
# Each of the parameters lsited below, can be accesed as vectors of 'params', using `params$value`

# Goals

By the end of this document, we will have learned:

- What R and RStudio are and are not
- How to download, install, and run R and RStudio

\newpage
# What is R?

![R Logo](./Assets/Logos/Rlogo.png){width=1in}

As described by the R foundation^[https://www.r-project.org/about.html]:

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes:

- an effective data handling and storage facility,
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

R is a simple and robust tool for quickly, efficiently, and repeatably performing data science tasks throughout the course of your Green Team projects.

<!-- \newpage -->
# What is RStudio?

![RStudio Logo](./Assets/Logos/RStudiologocrop.png){width=1in}

As described by the RStudio team^[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/]:

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. 

RStudio is the software that provides an ease-of-use to working with the R programming language. The majority of your interactions with the R language during the course of the Green Team program will be through the RStudio software platform. There are few reasons to use just the R console instead of RStudio when performing data science tasks, particularly when performing exploratory data analysis tasks typical of Green Team projects.

\newpage
# What is the difference?

There are some important differences to remember when using R and RStudio.

## R

R is the programming language and interpreter. 
The R console is responsible for performing all of our instructions, written out as R code (.R files).
We can type code directly into the R console to execute R commands like-by-line, or we can execute pre-written R scripts (.R files). 
Experienced users will be able to write a variety of scripts to perform automated and repeatable tasks using R, and Batch or Shell scripts (based on your operating system).


## RStudio

RStudio is the premier Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for R, and is the recommended method for interacting with the R console, and using R to perform your data science tasks during the course of the Green Team program.
RStudio provides a large number of helpful features for working with R, including an environment viewer, file manager, syntax-highlighting, spell-check and code-completion, and an internal documentation viewer. RStudio additionally provides support for managing different R projects, which will be helpful for collaborating with your other Green Team members.


## So which do I use?

R behaves the same whether you are using the interactive console, or using R via the integrated console within RStudio.
The console view is not beginner-friendly, and does not provide many helpful features such as the robust code-completion or syntax-highlighting that is available within RStudio.
As a result, it is **highly recommended** that you use RStudio to perform your analyses; using the R console view is **not recommended** for the course of the Green Teams program.

# Download and Install R

Download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at:

https://cloud.r-project.org/

- Windows users will download an executable installer (.exe)
- Mac users will download a package installer (.pkg)
- Linux users have access via package management systems
- R must be installed before RStudio

# Download and Install RStudio

Download RStudio Desktop from the RStudio team at:

https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

- Windows users will download an executable installer (.exe)
- Mac users will download a disk image file (.dmg)
- Linux users will download a package file (.deb, .rpm)

\newpage
# Launch R

![R Console](./Assets/Images/RTerm.png){width=6in}

R is run inside of your computer's terminal, and can be accessed interactively via command line interface, or passively via scripting.
R is launched via the `R.exe` application on Windows, or through the terminal via `R`, as a variable in your `PATH`. The R console can be used as an interactive session, or be used for scripting by more experienced users.

R commands are run interactively in the console line-by-line, or by writing and executing an R source file (.R file).

\newpage
# Launch RStudio

![RStudio](./Assets/Images/RStudioTerm.png){width=6in}


RStudio is run as a desktop application, which acts as an easier way to interact with the R console. 
RStudio provides the following features in its multi-panel layout:

- a file and graphics viewer (on the bottom right pane by default), 
- an environment viewer to keep track of data and variables used by the R session (on the top right pane by default),
- access to the R console (on the bottom left pane by default), and
- access to a document editor with syntax-highlighting (on the top left pane by default).

RStudio allows for a much easier experience running R commands interactively in the console line-by-line, or writing and executing an R source file (.R file).

# Questions?

If you have any trouble installing R or RStudio, please contact:

`r params$name` at `r params$contact`.

We will be using R during the training sessions, so it is important that it is installed before attending.
