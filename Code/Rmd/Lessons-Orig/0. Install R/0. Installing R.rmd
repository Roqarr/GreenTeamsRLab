# Arguments ----
# Defines the parameters to pass into the Rmd document for knitting.
# Parameters allow you to pass arguments into the Rmd document, similar to a function, to create dynamic reports.
# Similar to a function, you must define the parameters at the beginning of the report, and can assign default values.
# These parameters can be accessed inside the Rmd document using a special environment object: 'params'
# The 'params' object is a special read-only environment object.
# Each of the parameters lsited below, can be accesed as vectors of 'params', using `params$value`

# Date; Use Pipe to allow multiple lines or inline R code.
# R code can be accepted in most arguments using the backtick / backquote character '`' (located above the tab key).
# This example will use an R function to pull the current date, and add it to the document as the entry for the date.
# You could alternatively write in text for a fixed Year, Semester, Quarter, etc.
