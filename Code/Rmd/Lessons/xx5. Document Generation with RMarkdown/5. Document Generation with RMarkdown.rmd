# Date; Use Pipe to allow multiple lines or inline R code.
# R code can be accepted in most arguments using the backtick / backquote character '`' (located above the tab key).
# This example will use an R function to pull the current date, and add it to the document as the entry for the date.
# You could alternatively write in text for a fixed Year, Semester, Quarter, etc.

# So What Can R Do?

![](./Reports/Logos/Rlogo.png)

# Sort and Tabulate Data

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# This chunk uses some examples from the mtcars dataset. 
# This dataset is pre-loaded into R, and is commonly used as an example data set for statistical tests and graphing.
# However, this data frame has the row names assigned as the make and model of the automobile, as we will see in the Table section below.
# This code will create a new data frame, removing the row names, and will add a vector of those names instead, which we can work with much easier.
kmtcars = mtcars # Make a copy of mtcars to process
kmtcars$model = rownames(mtcars) # Add a vector of data
rownames(kmtcars) = NULL
kmtcars = kmtcars %>% select(model, everything())

# Subset the data frame, choosing only the following columns.
# The example below includes both the functional and piped forms of this code, which behave the same.

# Functional Example
skmtcars = select(kmtcars,
                  model, 
                  mpg,
                  cyl,
                  disp,
                  hp
                  )

# Order the data frame in decreasing order of MPG
# Assign the order of the data frame to be in descending order of MPG. 
# In case of a tie, the first column value is used as a tie-breaker (i.e., is sorted alphabetically).
skmtcars = skmtcars[order(skmtcars$mpg, decreasing = T),] 
skmtcars = skmtcars[skmtcars$cyl==4,] # Subset the data frame, to only include
skmtcars = head(skmtcars)

  escape = F, # This time the escape is F, because we want to process some escape characters; i.e., the '\n' used in our line breaks for our multi-row column names.
  longtable = T, # Use the longtable package, loaded in the YAML section. This supports tables that are long, supports tables that can wrap across pages. It also centers the table on the page. This is generally recommended.
  format = "pipe", # The document format. For this example, it is a pdf document, which uses LaTeX to render, so our format is latex.
  linesep = "", # A separator to include after each line / a set of lines. The default value puts a space every 5 items. This removes the space.

# Download and Install R

Download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at:

https://cloud.r-project.org/

- Windows users will download an executable installer (.exe)
- Mac users will download a package installer (.pkg)
- Linux users have access via package management systems
- R can be compiled from source on other Unix devices

# Download and Install RStudio

Download RStudio from the RSTudio team at:

https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

- Windows users will download an executable installer (.exe)
- Mac users will download a disk image file (.dmg)
- Linux users will download a package file (.deb, .rpm)

# Launch R

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

![](./Reports/Images/RTerm.png)

:::

::: {.column}

R is run inside of your computer's terminal, and can be accessed interactively via command line interface, or passively via scripting.
R is launched via the `R.exe` application on Windows, or through the terminal via `R`, as a variable in your `PATH`. 

:::
::::::

# Launch RStudio

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

![](./Reports/Images/RStudioTerm.png)

:::

::: {.column}

RStudio is run as a desktop application, which acts as an R project manager, and supports file management and version controlling features.

:::
::::::

# Install R Packages

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

R packages are installed in the CLI via the `install.packages()` function. This will install packages from CRAN, or local directories. Packages in development or not on CRAN are installed via the `install_github()` function, in the package `devtools`. Examples of installing packages are available inside this sample project at `./Code/R/Boot/Install Packages.R`.

# Load R Packages

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

R packages are loaded in the CLI via the `library()` function. This will load packages that have already been installed into the current R environment. Once a package is loaded, it is loaded for the remainder of the R session. Note that some packages have dependencies and may need to be loaded in a specific order. Examples of loading packages are available inside this sample project at `./Code/R/Boot/Load Packages.R`.

# R Projects and Project Directories

- `Projects` are a base feature of R, expanded on by RStudio. 
- The `Project Directory` or `Working Directory` is where R is started
- `Project Directories` allow the use of relative file paths in code
- `Project Directories` allow the use of version controlling
- An `R Project` should be organized as a directory containing at least:
- - `.Rprofile`
- - Code Directory
- - Data Directory


# Project Features of R

- R is called to a directory, and assigns that directory as the `Working Directory`
- - When using RStudio, this is where your R Project is located as well
- After R starts, it looks for a file named `.Rprofile` at the top level of the `Working Directory`, and executes the contents
- - The `.Rprofile` is useful for having  consistent and project-specific environments
- - The `.Rprofile` is also used in RMarkdown document generation, and supports rendering documents consistently in interactive mode
- When R closes, it looks for a function in the environment named `.Last()`, and executes the function
- - The `.Last()` is useful for generating time-stamps, log files, or removing temporary files

# Changing and Sharing Projects

- RStudio facilitates working with multiple projects with a project manager
- Version controlling using `GitHub` becomes possible for collaboration and archiving, and is integrated inside of RStudio
- By using project directories and relative file paths, projects can be shared for collaboration
- Example Projects are often maintained on GitHub by package developers this way
