# This is the RMD script for powerpoint document generation
# Arguments ----
# Defines the parameters to pass into the Rmd document for knitting.
# Parameters allow you to pass arguments into the Rmd document, similar to a function, to create dynamic reports.
# Similar to a function, you must define the parameters at the beginning of the report, and can assign default values.
# These parameters can be accessed inside the Rmd document using a special environment object: 'params'
# The 'params' object is a special read-only environment object.
# Each of the parameters lsited below, can be accesed as vectors of 'params', using `params$value`
params:
 state: "New Jersey"
 university: "Montclair State University"

# The List of Authors, separated by a new line and preceeded by a '-' and a space
# Authors will be placed on a line, and automatically centered
# Notes about the authors, as footnotes, can be added with '^[]', with the contents of the footnote placed inside of the brackets.

# Date; Use Pipe to allow multiple lines or inline R code.
# R code can be accepted in most arguments using the backtick / backquote character '`' (located above the tab key).
# This example will use an R function to pull the current date, and add it to the document as the entry for the date.
# You could alternatively write in text for a fixed Year, Semester, Quarter, etc.

#  Here is placeholder abstract Text.
#  It can have multiple lines, and should be limited to a brief description of the paper, if you choose to add one.

# Table of Contents Settings
# Do you want to add a Table of Contents? True or False
toc: True
# The Defined Title of the Table of Contents
# You can specify a title for the Table of Contents here. The example asserts that the toc is called 'Table of Contents'.
toc-title: "Table of Contents"
# The Defined depth of headers to include in the Table of Contents. 
# This value impacts the TOC and Sidebar Navigation in PDF views.
# Provide a number of how many headings / subheadings you want to have presented in the Table of Contents.
# This example will show Headings (1) and Sub-Headings (2), but will not display any section headings at 3 or below.
toc-depth: 2
# Do you want to add a Table of Figures? True or False
# This will add a separate table, listing all of the defined figures.

# Sort and Tabulate Data

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# This chunk uses some examples from the mtcars dataset. 
# This dataset is pre-loaded into R, and is commonly used as an example data set for statistical tests and graphing.
# However, this data frame has the row names assigned as the make and model of the automobile, as we will see in the Table section below.
# This code will create a new data frame, removing the row names, and will add a vector of those names instead, which we can work with much easier.
kmtcars = mtcars # Make a copy of mtcars to process
kmtcars$model = rownames(mtcars) # Add a vector of data
rownames(kmtcars) = NULL
kmtcars = kmtcars %>% select(model, everything())

# Subset the data frame, choosing only the following columns.
# The example below includes both the functional and piped forms of this code, which behave the same.

# Functional Example
skmtcars = select(kmtcars,
                  model, 
                  mpg,
                  cyl,
                  disp,
                  hp
                  )

# Order the data frame in decreasing order of MPG
# Assign the order of the data frame to be in descending order of MPG. 
# In case of a tie, the first column value is used as a tie-breaker (i.e., is sorted alphabetically).
skmtcars = skmtcars[order(skmtcars$mpg, decreasing = T),] 
skmtcars = skmtcars[skmtcars$cyl==4,] # Subset the data frame, to only include
skmtcars = head(skmtcars)
rownames(skmtcars) = NULL # Reset the row numbers, otherwise, they will appear as a new column in our table.

  escape = F, # This time the escape is F, because we want to process some escape characters; i.e., the '\n' used in our line breaks for our multi-row column names.
  longtable = T, # Use the longtable package, loaded in the YAML section. This supports tables that are long, supports tables that can wrap across pages. It also centers the table on the page. This is generally recommended.
  format = "pipe", # The document format. For this example, it is a pdf document, which uses LaTeX to render, so our format is latex.

This presentation was created in R!
It is created using R Markdown. 
This combines Markdown formatting and R code.
Using this, we can make tables and graphs quickly,

This is the first guided lab section, and will act as a quick introduction to how to begin using R and its Interactive Development Environment (IDE) RStudio.

Launch RStudio now if you have not done so already. You should see a screen similar to the one below.
